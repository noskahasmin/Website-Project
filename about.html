        <h1>ENHYPEN</h1>
        <center>
        <p>Enhypen is a South Korean boy band formed by Belift Lab. 
           Formerly a joint venture between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation,
           the group was formed through the 2020 survival competition show I-Land.
           The group consists of seven members: Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo,
           Jungwon, and Ni-ki. They debuted on November 30, 2020,
           with the extended play (EP) Border: Day One.
           The name Enhypen was introduced during the live broadcast of the final episode of I-Land.
           Etymologically, the group derives their name from the hyphen symbol (-), 
           representing "Connection, Discovery, & Growth".[5] Similar to how a hyphen
           connects different words to create new meanings, Enhypen aims "to come together to connect,
           discover and grow together to form a new act".

           Taiwan, and Japan, among others locations, seeking male trainees born between 1997 and 2008.
           On May 8, 2020, television channel Mnet announced the survival competition series I-Land as part of the
           joint venture between the two entertainment companies that "follows the process of next generation K-pop artists
           being born".Enhypen was formed through the show, which featured 23 male trainees, some of whom were originally
           auditioned for Belift, while others transferred from Big Hit Music. 
           The show aired weekly on Mnet from June 26 to September 18, 2020, and internationally on Hybe Labels' YouTube channel.
           The series was split into two parts, with the top twelve contestants from the first part advancing to the second.
           On the last episode of the show, seven members were selected out of the nine final contestants, with six chosen by global rankings
           and one by producers' choice. The final lineup of Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-ki was announced
           on the live television broadcast of the finale.
